# SKY SHARDS BOT
This bot was created for the purpose of getting shards data for Sky Shards website and publishing it's content on discord for easy access.

I do not intend to steal content from other people's work, I give full credit to Plutoy for creating a wonderful website(https://sky-shards.pages.dev/). I admire him for making this website. It's truly helpful to people like us. I merely made this bot so that getting those information is little bit easier.

And I give thanks to all those who had hands in discovering shards pattern, without them, neither the website nor this bot would've been possible.
## Bot is coded with nodejs.
Run the command with either 'node index.js' or 'node shards.js'
